### Theoretical

Theoretical answers were to be submitted in a plain text file with the answer letters, but you provided a word document with the answer values.
Of course I just downloaded it and checked anyways, but paying attention to details will go a long ways in your career as a software developer.

### Practical

1. Very good!
2. Good! Minor mistake if the inputs are `98, 2` (a.k.a. their sum is exactly 100)
3. Technically correct. It does use stuff that we haven't learned about yet, and I'd suggest you try solving it on your own.

### Tips:
- You're getting proficient with the basics, very good.
- You should only use code from the internet if you understand it. Otherwise it can backfire in the long run.
